Loot such as weapons, ammo, clothing and equipement can be found in buildings. Almost every item in the game (and any mods you have loaded) should be possible to find.
<br />
<br />
There are also some special loot items that can be found:
<br />
<br />
<font color='#FFCC00'>Loot Drone</font> - Find the purple drone box to reveal all the loot on the map
<br />
<br />
<font color='#FFCC00'>Cash Money</font> - Finding the pile of cash gives you points based on the kill points multiplier (default 5000).
<br />
<br />
<font color='#FFCC00'>Satellite Dish</font> - Unlocks the Support Menu at the Bulwark Box and rewards you with Points! One will spawn each wave until found. (Needs to be enabled in mission paramters)
